Send signals to a Sinclair joystick port from a Raspberry Pi.

The Spectrum +2A and +3 come with two special joystick ports. They look like Atari, but aren't.

I have this itch of connecting my favourite USB gamepads to the Spectrum. Luckily, there's the Raspberry Pi Zero and its GPIO pins. With them and a level shifter you can trick the Spectrum +2A into believing there's a joystick connected to one of its special ports.

This project includes a Raspberry Pi Zero hat with a level shifter and a DB9 to do exactly that.
